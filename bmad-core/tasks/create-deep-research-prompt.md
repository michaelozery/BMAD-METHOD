# Create Deep Research Prompt Task

## Purpose

Generate exceptionally comprehensive research prompts that drive deep, actionable insights for complex business and product decisions. This task leverages advanced AI analytical capabilities to create structured prompts that go beyond surface-level research and uncover the strategic intelligence needed for critical decision-making.

## Why This Systematic Approach Works

Well-crafted research prompts are the foundation of valuable insights because they ensure comprehensive coverage, prevent research gaps, and guide systematic investigation toward actionable conclusions. By providing clear objectives, detailed methodology, and specific deliverable requirements, we enable researchers (human or AI) to focus their efforts on high-impact areas that directly inform key business decisions.

## Key Outcomes

**Go beyond the basics to create fully comprehensive research frameworks that:**

- Define crystal-clear research objectives with specific success criteria because vague objectives lead to unfocused research that doesn't inform decisions
- Specify proven research methodologies tailored to the specific research type because methodology determines the quality and reliability of insights
- Outline detailed deliverable formats that decision-makers can immediately act upon because research value is measured by its impact on strategic choices
- Guide systematic investigation that leaves no critical gaps because incomplete research creates dangerous blind spots in decision-making
- Ensure every insight directly connects to actionable next steps because research without clear implications wastes valuable time and resources

## Research Type Selection

**Critical First Step:** Collaborate with the user to identify the most strategic research focus that will deliver maximum decision-making value. This foundation step is essential because the right research type determines whether insights will be immediately actionable or merely interesting academic exercises.

### 2. Input Processing and Context Analysis

**When Project Brief is provided,** extract and synthesize these elements because they form the strategic foundation for focused research:

<research_context_analysis>
- **Core product concepts and strategic goals** - These define what success looks like and guide research priorities
- **Target users and primary use cases** - Understanding the audience ensures research relevance and applicability
- **Technical constraints and implementation preferences** - These boundaries prevent research into non-viable solutions
- **Key uncertainties and untested assumptions** - These represent the highest-risk areas requiring immediate investigation
</research_context_analysis>

**When Brainstorming Results are provided,** synthesize and prioritize insights because raw brainstorming needs strategic filtering:

- **Central themes and recurring ideas** - Patterns indicate areas of consensus and potential opportunity
- **Concepts requiring market validation** - Creative ideas need real-world testing before resource investment
- **Testable hypotheses and assumptions** - These become the core questions driving research methodology
- **High-potential directions needing deeper exploration** - Promising concepts that warrant comprehensive investigation

**When Existing Market Research is provided,** build strategically upon previous findings because incremental insight building is more efficient than starting fresh:

- **Identified opportunities requiring deeper analysis** - Surface-level findings need comprehensive exploration
- **Specific market insights needing validation** - Initial findings require confirmation through additional research
- **Adjacent market possibilities** - Related opportunities that emerged from core research
- **Gaps in current understanding** - Areas where existing research is incomplete or outdated

**When Starting Fresh,** establish comprehensive research foundation because solid groundwork prevents misdirected effort:

- **Essential business context and strategic objectives** - Research must align with broader organizational goals
- **Problem definition and scope boundaries** - Clear parameters prevent research scope creep
- **Success criteria and decision points** - Specific outcomes that will trigger strategic actions
- **Resource constraints and timeline requirements** - Realistic boundaries that shape research methodology

## Comprehensive Research Prompt Development

### 3. Strategic Research Framework Creation

**Collaborate intensively with the user** to develop an exceptional research prompt that goes beyond basic requirements. This collaborative approach is crucial because the prompt's quality directly determines the research's strategic value and decision-making impact.

#### A. Strategic Research Objectives

<research_objectives>
**Collaborate with the user to articulate crystal-clear, measurable objectives** because vague objectives lead to unfocused research that fails to inform critical decisions.

- **Specific decisions this research will directly inform** - Concrete choices that depend on these insights, with decision-makers identified
- **Quantifiable success criteria** - Measurable outcomes that indicate research completeness and quality
- **Scope boundaries and constraints** - Clear parameters that prevent research scope creep and ensure focused effort
- **Strategic impact and urgency** - Why this research matters now and how it connects to broader organizational objectives
</research_objectives>

#### B. Strategic Research Questions Framework

<research_questions>
**Collaborate intensively to develop laser-focused, actionable research questions** because well-crafted questions determine whether research delivers strategic insights or generic information.

**Primary Investigation Questions (Must Answer):**

- **Priority ranking with rationale** - Order of importance based on strategic impact and urgency
- **Question interdependencies** - How answers to certain questions inform or prerequisite others
- **Success metrics for each question** - How to measure whether each question has been adequately answered

**Secondary Exploration Questions (Strategic Context):**
- **Context-building questions** - Additional insights that enhance decision-making confidence
- **Competitive intelligence needs** - What we need to understand about market dynamics and competitors
- **Future-focused considerations** - Trends and possibilities that could affect long-term strategy
- **Risk identification questions** - Potential challenges, obstacles, or failure modes to investigate
</research_questions>

#### C. Comprehensive Research Methodology

<research_methodology>
**Design a rigorous methodology that ensures reliable, actionable insights** because methodology determines the credibility and usefulness of research outcomes.

**Data Collection Strategy:**

**Analytical Framework Selection:**
- **Primary analysis methodologies** - Specific frameworks (SWOT, Porter's Five Forces, Jobs-to-be-Done, etc.) chosen for their relevance to research objectives
- **Comparison and evaluation criteria** - Standardized metrics for assessing options, opportunities, or competitive positions  
- **Synthesis approaches** - How disparate insights will be integrated into coherent, actionable recommendations
- **Quality assurance processes** - Methods for validating findings and identifying potential research gaps or biases
</research_methodology>

#### D. Strategic Output Requirements

<output_specifications>
**Design deliverables that immediately enable decision-making** because research value is measured by its impact on strategic actions, not by volume of information collected.

**Executive Summary Requirements:**
- **Key findings synthesis** - 2-3 most critical insights that directly inform primary decisions
- **Immediate action recommendations** - Specific next steps with priority ranking and resource requirements
